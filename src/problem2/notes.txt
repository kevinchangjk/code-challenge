Concept: A transaction form on BSC network, with available toke

Overall Design:
  Form component: contains receiving address, amount to send (max button also available),
  token to send, memo / safety message
  Confirmation Modal component: contains 6-digit OTP authentication, confirmation message. 
    If done properly, transaction status modal appears as submitted, else it
    appears as rejected.
  Status Component: Shows transaction status, as well as any errors in modal form.
  Header component: Might as well
  Account component: Displays just username, and recent transactions.
    Upon clicking, opens up a modal with full account details there.
  Account Details component: Contains username, list of tokens and balances
    as well as linked mobile number. Also has full list of transaction details.

So when opening the form, a fake account should be loaded, with my username and 
all that. It should have some random tokens and balances, and a place to link 
mobile number. Then I can proceed to send tokens.

Errors: 

2. No balance. An error message will appear underneath the balance input, and 
  submit button will be grayed out
3. Incorrect address type based on network type. Error message appears underneath
4. Transaction rejected. User closes modal or clicks reject. Status modal appears, 
  saying it has been rejected.
5. Incorrect OTP. I think for OTP, just use 111111 or something. Then anything other
  than that, have Status modal pop up, to say incorrect OTP, transaction cancelled.

TODO:

All:
Use a nicer font

Transaction Form:
